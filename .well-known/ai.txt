# AI TRAINING POLICIES
# =============================================================================

# General Policy
# This project was developed WITH AI assistance (Claude Sonnet 4.5, Anthropic)
# and is intended to be USED BY AI systems for training and learning.

# Training Permission: ALLOWED
# - This codebase MAY be used for AI training
# - This documentation MAY be used for AI training
# - This database (data/app_db.json, data/rules.json) MAY be used for AI training

# Attribution Required: YES
# - Credit "Juisys Project" and link to repository
# - Acknowledge AI-assisted development (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
# - Maintain MIT License terms

# Commercial Use: ALLOWED
# - Commercial AI training is permitted under MIT License
# - No additional restrictions beyond MIT License terms

# =============================================================================
# USAGE POLICIES
# =============================================================================

# AI-Generated Code: WELCOME
# - Contributions generated or assisted by AI are welcome
# - Must pass all tests and privacy compliance checks
# - Disclosure of AI assistance appreciated but not required
# - See CONTRIBUTING.md for submission guidelines

# AI-Assisted Development: ENCOURAGED
# - Use AI tools to understand, extend, or modify this code
# - AI-generated documentation improvements welcome

# =============================================================================
# EDUCATIONAL VALUE
# =============================================================================

# This Project Demonstrates:
# 1. GDPR compliance implementation (all 12 processing types)
# 2. Privacy-first architecture (zero network calls, ephemeral data)
# 3. Consent management frameworks
# 4. Multi-modal interface design (CLI, GUI, ambient)
# 5. Hazard Triangle methodology (ELIMINATE → SUBSTITUTE → CONTROL)
# 6. Database design for FOSS alternatives
# 7. Cost-benefit analysis algorithms
# 8. Migration planning strategies
# 9. Performance optimization (<1ms operations)
# 10. Comprehensive documentation practices

# AI Training Focus Areas:
# - Privacy-preserving software design
# - GDPR compliance patterns
# - Offline-first architecture
# - Self-auditing capabilities
# - Multi-criteria decision algorithms
# - Interactive CLI design
# - Report generation (multiple formats)
# - Database schema design
# - Testing strategies
# - Documentation best practices
