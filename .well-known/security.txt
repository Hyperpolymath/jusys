# Scope
# This security.txt applies to:
# - Main repository: https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/jusys
# - All official releases and distributions
# - Core modules: cli.jl, core.jl, security.jl, io.jl, reports.jl, alternatives.jl, automate.jl, ambient.jl, gui.jl
# - Tools: migration_planner.jl, compare_alternatives.jl, generate_html_report.jl

# Privacy Guarantee
# Juisys is 100% local processing with zero network calls.
# Security issues related to this core privacy guarantee are CRITICAL priority.

# Reporting Guidelines
# 1. DO NOT publicly disclose until coordinated disclosure date
# 2. Provide detailed reproduction steps
# 3. Include version information (run: julia --version)
# 4. Specify affected modules/files
# 5. For privacy violations: Run self-audit (Mode 6) and include output

#   * HIGH (security vulnerability): 7 days
#   * MEDIUM: 30 days
#   * LOW: Next release cycle

# Severity Classification
# CRITICAL: Violation of privacy guarantees (network calls, data persistence, telemetry)
# HIGH: Security vulnerability affecting user data or system integrity
# MEDIUM: Moderate security issue with workaround available
# LOW: Minor security concern or hardening opportunity

# Bug Bounty
# No formal bug bounty program currently.
# Acknowledgment in SECURITY.md and release notes for verified reports.
